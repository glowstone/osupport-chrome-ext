# Open Tip Chrome Extension

A Chrome extension allowing users to show appreciation and monetary support for online content they enjoy. Privately logs pages visited in your browser's local
storage so that periodic payments can be made to a randomly selected site. Site selection is weighted by visit duration so that sites you spend the most time on are more likely to be selected. Averaged over all users of Open Support, popular web articles, pages, and other content will receive a greater proportion of user monetary support.

This project was begun by to satisfy the requirements of MIT course 6.UAP and to constitute the senior project of Dalton Hubble, under the advisorship of Professor David Karger. The project was inspired by previous work on the web page licensing and patronage framework Firefox extension [Tipsy](https://code.google.com/p/tipsy/) by Professor David Karger, et al.
